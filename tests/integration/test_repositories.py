TEST DESCRIPTION BLOCK â€” tests/integration/test_repositories.py

Purpose
-------
Exercise a minimal, end-to-end repository interaction with a **transactional Session**.
Intended as a smoke-level integration test once a trivial model/table exists.

What to include
---------------
1) Imports:
   - stdlib: uuid
   - third-party: pytest
   - local: tests/fixtures/db.py (db_session), app.repositories.base_repository.BaseRepository
           and possibly a simple concrete repository (e.g., OrganisationRepository) once available
           plus ORM models from app.models.* if needed.

2) Marker:
   - @pytest.mark.integration

3) Pre-conditions:
   - A simple table/model with a primary key exists via migrations (e.g., organisations).
   - Corresponding SQLAlchemy model and repository are implemented.

4) Tests (examples; adjust to your first real entity):
   - test_base_repository_session_lifecycle(db_session):
       * Arrange: instantiate BaseRepository(db_session); execute a trivial SELECT 1 query via session.
       * Assert: no exceptions; session is open during test and closed after.
   - test_organisation_repository_roundtrip(db_session):
       * Arrange: repo = OrganisationRepository(db_session)
       * Act: create -> fetch -> assert fields -> delete (or rely on test rollback)
       * Assert: fetched entity matches inserted data; repository methods behave.

Constraints
-----------
- Rely on the per-test transaction rollback to avoid persistent writes.
- Keep these tests minimal and stable; favor table-driven assertions.

Dependencies on other scripts
-----------------------------
- app/repositories/base_repository.py
- app/repositories/organisation_repository.py (or your first concrete repo)
- app/models/core.py (and your first entity model)
- tests/fixtures/db.py : db_session fixture

Notes
-----
- Until a real model exists, you can keep this file with TODO tests or skipped tests.
- Once the first model lands, enable real CRUD tests here.
