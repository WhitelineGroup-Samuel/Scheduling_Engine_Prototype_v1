# POLICY DIGEST

## Scope & Purpose
- Define standardized practices to ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the Scheduling Engine project.
- Facilitate clear communication and understanding among developers, testers, and stakeholders.
- Establish guidelines for error handling, logging, configuration, testing, documentation, and security.
- Support compliance with company-wide policies and industry best practices.

## Coding Standards
- Follow consistent naming conventions: use camelCase for variables and functions, PascalCase for classes.
- Ensure code is modular, reusable, and adheres to SOLID principles.
- Maintain code readability with clear comments and appropriate whitespace.
- Enforce linting rules to catch syntax and style issues before commit.
- Avoid hardcoding values; use configuration files or environment variables instead.
- Write functions with single responsibility and limit their length to improve maintainability.

## Error Handling & Exit Codes
- Use structured error handling with try-catch blocks or equivalent mechanisms.
- Provide meaningful error messages that aid debugging without exposing sensitive information.
- Define and document standard exit codes for common failure scenarios.
- Log errors with sufficient context to facilitate root cause analysis.
- Avoid silent failures; ensure all errors are either handled or explicitly propagated.

## Logging & Observability
- Implement centralized logging with consistent format and severity levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR).
- Include timestamps, module names, and correlation IDs in log entries.
- Enable configurable log levels to support different environments (development, staging, production).
- Integrate monitoring and alerting tools to detect anomalies and failures in real-time.
- Ensure logs do not contain sensitive data such as passwords or personal information.

## Configuration & Environments
- Store configuration parameters in environment-specific files or environment variables.
- Use secure methods to manage secrets and credentials (e.g., vaults, encrypted files).
- Support dynamic configuration reloads without requiring service restarts.
- Document all configuration options with default values and expected formats.
- Isolate environment-specific logic to prevent accidental cross-environment issues.

## Database & Migrations
- Design database schema following normalization principles to reduce redundancy.
- Use migration scripts to version and automate database changes.
- Validate migrations in staging environments before production deployment.
- Backup databases regularly and maintain rollback plans for migrations.
- Enforce access controls and audit logging on database operations.

## Testing & CI
- Write comprehensive unit tests covering all critical code paths.
- Implement integration and end-to-end tests to validate system interactions.
- Use continuous integration (CI) pipelines to automate testing on every commit.
- Enforce code coverage thresholds and fail builds on unmet criteria.
- Perform regular test suite maintenance to remove flaky or obsolete tests.

## Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date documentation for code, APIs, and system architecture.
- Use markdown or similar formats for readability and version control compatibility.
- Document function signatures, parameters, return values, and side effects.
- Include usage examples and common troubleshooting steps.
- Review and update documentation as part of the development lifecycle.

## Security & Compliance
- Follow least privilege principles for access control and data handling.
- Sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
- Comply with relevant legal and regulatory requirements, including data privacy laws.

## Glossary (Critical Terms)
- **Scheduling Engine**: Core system responsible for managing and executing scheduling tasks.
- **Migration**: Script or process that modifies the database schema or data.
- **CI Pipeline**: Automated process that builds, tests, and deploys code changes.
- **Exit Code**: Numeric code returned by a process indicating success or failure.
- **Correlation ID**: Unique identifier used to trace requests across distributed systems.

## Non-Negotiables
- All code must pass linting and testing before merging.
- Sensitive information must never be logged or exposed.
- Database migrations require peer review and testing.
- Documentation updates are mandatory for all new features and significant changes.
- Security best practices must be adhered to without exception.

## Open Questions
- How to handle backward compatibility for database schema changes in multi-version deployments?
- What is the standardized format for log correlation IDs across all microservices?
- Should configuration management support feature toggles for experimental functionalities?
- What is the process for emergency rollback in case of critical production failures?
- How frequently should security audits and penetration testing be scheduled?
