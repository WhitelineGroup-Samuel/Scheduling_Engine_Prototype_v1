# Documentation Standards

## Purpose

This document establishes the standards and best practices for creating and maintaining documentation within the project. It ensures consistency, clarity, and accessibility across all documentation artifacts, enabling efficient onboarding, development, and maintenance.

## Philosophy

Our documentation aims to be comprehensive and developer-focused. We prioritize clarity and precision to support developers at all levels, from newcomers to experts. Documentation should provide enough context to understand the "why" behind decisions and implementations, not just the "what." This approach fosters deeper understanding and better collaboration.

## Auto-Maintained Docs (README and ADRs)

- **README and Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** are maintained automatically where possible.
- Documentation diffs generated by automated tools are git-ready, facilitating easy review and integration.
- Auto-maintained docs reduce manual overhead and ensure documentation stays synchronized with code changes.

## Glossary Management

- A centralized glossary is maintained in `RootFolder/Project_Files/glossary.md`.
- Terms include both plain-language and technical definitions to accommodate diverse audiences.
- When new terms are detected in documentation or code comments, contributors are automatically prompted to add or update glossary entries.
- This ensures consistent terminology and helps onboard new team members efficiently.

## Docstring & Commenting Rules

- Use **Google style** docstrings for all public functions, classes, and methods.
- Docstrings must describe the purpose, parameters, return values, exceptions, and any side effects.
- Inline comments should be minimal and only used to explain complex or non-obvious logic.
- Focus comments on the "why" behind the code rather than the "what," which should be clear from the code itself.
- Private or internal functions may have less detailed docstrings but should still maintain clarity.

## Versioning & Change Tracking

- All significant documentation changes must be recorded in the project's **CHANGELOG.md** with clear, concise entries.
- Architectural or design changes must be documented in ADRs, stored in `RootFolder/Project_Files/adr/`.
- This practice provides traceability and historical context for decisions and changes.

## File/Folder Organization

- All documentation files are organized under the `RootFolder/Project_Files/` directory.
- This includes READMEs, ADRs, the glossary, changelogs, and any other supporting documentation.
- Consistent organization simplifies navigation and maintenance.

## Examples

### README Update Template

```markdown
# Project Name

## Overview

[Brief project description]

## Installation

[Instructions]

## Usage

[Examples]

## Contributing

[Guidelines]

## License

[License info]
```

### Glossary Entry Template

```markdown
### Term

**Definition:** A clear, concise explanation of the term in plain language.

**Technical Definition:** A detailed, technical explanation suitable for developers.
```

### Docstring Example (Google Style)

```python
def calculate_area(width, height):
    """Calculate the area of a rectangle.

    Args:
        width (float): The width of the rectangle.
        height (float): The height of the rectangle.

    Returns:
        float: The calculated area.
    """
    return width * height
```

### Good vs Bad Commenting

**Good:**

```python
# Use a binary search here because the list is sorted, improving performance.
def find_item(sorted_list, target):
    ...
```

**Bad:**

```python
# Increment i by 1
i += 1
```

## TL;DR

- Write comprehensive, developer-focused documentation.
- Use Google style docstrings for public APIs.
- Maintain auto-updated READMEs and ADRs with git-ready diffs.
- Centralize glossary in `glossary.md` with plain and technical definitions.
- Document changes in CHANGELOG and ADRs.
- Organize all docs under `RootFolder/Project_Files/`.
- Focus comments on explaining "why" over "what."
- Use provided templates for consistency.
